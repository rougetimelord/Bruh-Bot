# Bruh Bot
A simple discord bot that says bruh every time someone leaves the server.

## Usage
* The invite link is [this](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=702644157692379267&permissions=67584&scope=bot)
* The bot will message your guild's system channel with a setup message. If there is no system channel, use `!set` in a channel that is accessible to the bot.

## Self Hosting
To self host the bot:
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Replace `token` in `key_example.json`, and rename the file to `key.json`. 

## Disclaimers
* The developer (me) is not liable for the accuracy, usefulness or availability of this bot. (It's literally hosted on a 5 year old 2 in 1 laptop ðŸ˜‚)
* This bot will only store the ID of your server and the ID of the channel to send to. (Don't believe me? Audit the code)
* This software is provided as is with no warranty. (I literally coded this in 3 hours as a joke)
